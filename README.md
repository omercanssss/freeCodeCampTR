## freeCodeCamp.org's açık kaynak kod tabanı ve eğitim programı.

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 40,000 people get their first developer job.

Bizim tam web geliştirme ve makine öğrenme eğitim programımız tamamen bedava. Yeteneklerinizi geliştirmeniz için binlerce interaktif kodlama programlarımız var.

### Sertifikalar

freeCodeCamp.org birkaç bedava geliştirici sertifikası sunar. Bu sertifakaların her biri bu projelere hazırlanmanıza yardımcı olacak yüzlerce isteğe bağlı kodlama meydan okuma ile birlikte 5 tane web uygulama projesi içerir. Yeni başlayan bir programcının bir sertifikayı kazanmısının yaklaşık 300 saat süreceğini tahmin ediyoruz.

freeCodeCamp.org müfredatındaki bu 50 projenin her birinin kendi çevik kullanıcı hikayeleri ve otomatik testleri vardır. Bunlar projenizi adım adım yapmanızı ve göndermeden önce tüm kullanıcı hikayelerini yerine getirdiğinizden emin olmanıza yardımcı olur.

Bu test paketlerini [freeCodeCamp'ın CDN'sinden](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) alabilirsiniz. Bu, bu projeleri CodePen ve Replit gibi web sitelerinde veya hatta yerel bilgisayarınızın geliştirme ortamında oluşturabileceğiniz anlamına gelir.


Bir sertifika kazandığınızda, o hep sizin olur. Her zaman LinkedIn veya resume'a yükleyebilirsiniz. Potansiyel işverenleriniz veya serbest müşterileriniz bu bağlantıya tıkladığında size özel doğrulanmış bir sertifika görecekler.

Bunun tek istisnası, [Akademik Dürüstlük Politikamızın](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/) ihlallerini keşfetmemizdir. Açıkça intihal yapan (diğer insanların kodlarını veya projelerini alıntı yapmadan kendilerininmiş gibi gönderen) insanları yakaladığımızda, tüm titiz öğrenme kurumlarının yapması gerekeni yaparız - sertifikalarını iptal eder ve bu insanları engelleriz.
